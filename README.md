# Foundations in Genomic Analyses Fall 2024
This repository is a landing page for the Foundations in Genomic Analyses workshop series held in fall quarter of 2024. This series aims to cover topics and skills foundational to conducting genomics-related research and is a collaboration between Northwestern IT's Research Computing and Data Services and the Galter Library, taught by Haley Carter and Pamela Shaw. 

## Workshop 6: Getting Started with nf-core Nextflow Pipelines

Nextflow is a workflow management tool designed to enable the creation of reproducible workflows that function across computational resources though the use of software containers. Many curated bioinformatics Nextflow pipelines can be found through the nf-core. In this workshop, we will explore their collection and work through running an nf-core pipeline on Quest. The biggest consideration for using Nextflow on Quest is setting the configuration to use Questâ€™s resources appropriately. We will cover how this is done through the nu-genomics profile for nf-core pipelines as well as writing a custom configuration file when necessary.
